# Running on the Path Less Traveled: Examining the Emergence and Evaluation of Unconventional Female Candidates

This repository contains selected data and code from my Senior Honors Thesis (Miami University '20).

## Abstract
A record number of women were elected to the U.S. Congress in 2018 (CAWP 2019).
Many of the newly elected women took more unconventional and varied paths to elective office
than their male counterparts. Understanding the emergence of women as candidates and voters’
attitudes towards them is imperative to reaching gender parity in government, yet prior research
has not addressed the interaction between a candidate’s gender and pathway to office. I fill this
gap with a two-part study. First, I use an original data set of the candidates for the U.S. House of
Representatives in 2018 paired with district-level data to find that candidate emergence is, to an
extent, dependent on both candidate gender and pathway to office. Next, I use a survey
experiment to find that voters base their evaluations and preferences primarily on a candidate’s
occupational background, rather than a candidate’s gender.
