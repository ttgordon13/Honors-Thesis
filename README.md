# Running on the Path Less Traveled: Examining the Emergence and Evaluation of Unconventional Female Candidates

This repository contains selected data and code from my Honors Thesis. I completed this project during my Senior year at Miami University (2019-2020). The project was fully-funded by the Dean's Scholar Award, which I earned in April of 2019. I have included excerpts from the paper to provide additional context below.

## Abstract
A record number of women were elected to the U.S. Congress in 2018 (CAWP 2019).
Many of the newly elected women took more unconventional and varied paths to elective office
than their male counterparts. Understanding the emergence of women as candidates and voters’
attitudes towards them is imperative to reaching gender parity in government, yet prior research
has not addressed the interaction between a candidate’s gender and pathway to office. I fill this
gap with a two-part study. First, I use an original data set of the candidates for the U.S. House of
Representatives in 2018 paired with district-level data to find that candidate emergence is, to an
extent, dependent on both candidate gender and pathway to office. Next, I use a survey
experiment to find that voters base their evaluations and preferences primarily on a candidate’s
occupational background, rather than a candidate’s gender.


## Methods
Observational Methods
Data collection
To study the emergence of unconventional female candidates, I conduct an observational
analysis of the major party candidates in the 2018 U.S. House of Representatives primary and
general elections using an original data set. Each candidate’s name, congressional district,
political party, and election results were compiled from FiveThirtyEight and MIT Election Data
Lab (FiveThirtyEight 2018; MIT Election Data Lab 2018). Each candidate’s gender, race,
highest educational attainment, prior political experience, and occupation prior to seeking public
office were collected from campaign websites, campaign social media pages, and news articles.
If no reliable or consistent occupational background information could be found for a particular
candidate, no occupation was recorded for that candidate. Of the 1,933 candidates represented in
the data, no reliable or consistent information on occupational background was found for 46
candidates (~2.4% of the total). These candidates are excluded from the subsequent analysis,
resulting in a final sample size of 1,887.

Candidates’ occupations were next aggregated into the categories used by the U.S.
Census Bureau in the American Community Survey. A series of dichotomous variables were
created to categorize specific occupations into broader industries. These categories include legal,
business, education, government and politics, science, social services, healthcare, production and
transportation, entertainment, natural resources, military, protective services, and other service
careers. A separate variable indicating prior elected experience was also created. This coding
was then used to define candidates as “conventional,” “semi-conventional,” or “unconventional.”

I draw on Lawless and Fox’s (2010) definition of the “candidate eligibility pool” to
define conventional candidates. Lawless and Fox identify the four occupations that most-often
precede a political candidacy: law, business, politics, and education. Therefore, I consider any
candidate with prior occupational experience in one of these fields to be a conventional
candidate. In contrast, any candidate who has no experience in any of these four fields is
considered an “unconventional” candidate. To account for candidates with experience in both
conventional and unconventional occupations, I code these candidates as semi-conventional. The
final sample consists of 61% conventional candidates, 23% semi-conventional candidates, and
16% unconventional candidates.

Finally, I merge the candidate data with congressional district-level demographic data.
The district-level variables included in the data set are adopted from Palmer and Simon’s (2008)
analysis of “women-friendly” districts. These variables include political indicators (Republican
vote share from the 2008, 2012, and 2016 presidential elections); demographic indicators (percentage of Black, Latinx, and foreign-born residents); socio-economic indicators (percentage of college graduates, relative median annual income, percentage of married women, average
family size, and number of families); geographic indicators (land area and population density); occupational indicators (percentage of women in conventional versus unconventional careers, as defined earlier); and, finally, the number of campaign training organizations located in the state
(Scott 2018). Data was collected primarily from the U.S. Census’ American Community Survey
five-year average (2013-2017) using the American Fact Finder tool (U.S. Census Bureau 2018).
Data on the population density of congressional districts was compiled by CityLab (CityLab
2018). The demographic data merged with the candidate data consists of my master data set.
